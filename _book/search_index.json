["content.html", "Content Part I Part II Part III", " Content 1-3 Paragraphs per chapter (will probably finish last) Part I Will re-hash the basics of regression models, focusing of features of what are often more familiar models that get expanded and built on in subsequent tutorials. At the end of these tutorials, will have a basic handle on linear regression models, generalized forms of linear regression, and maximum likelihood estimation. The end of the section will begin a transition to multilevel modeling by using a repeated measure ANOVA to highlight the transition from OLS estimation to a more general formulation of the logLikelihood function. Part II 0.0.1 Chapter 5 The Basics - A Multilevel Model with Random Intercepts Fancy Name for an ANOVA The statistical model Translating the statiscal model to code Checking model assumptions ANCOVA and Model Comparisons 0.0.2 Chapter 6 A Small Step Forward - Introducing Random Slopes Moving Past the ANOVA The statistical model Random Effects Covariance Matrix and Decomposition Centering Choices Adding Covariates/Predictors Checking model assumptions 0.0.3 Chapter 7 - “Growth” Models The special properties of time as a variable Centering Effects on Random Covariance/Correlation Matrix RCT/Experiments with Repeated Measures Non-linear change “lagged” predictors 0.0.4 Chapter 8 - Structural Equation Models SEM Crash Course: Path Models, Fit Indices, “Latent” variables Multilevel Factor Analysis - Structure and Theory SEM version of a Growth Model Parallel Growth Processes Inflection Point Detection Models Convergence Point Detection Models Further Reading 0.0.5 Chapter 9 - Complex Nesting Structures Adding a third “level” to a model The statistical model Translating to Code Understanding the Multiple Random Effect Covariance Matrices Cross-nested structures Individuals, Measured over Time, Nested within groups 0.0.6 Chapter 10 Interpreting your Model - Picture &gt; Words Stacked barplots (boo!!) Riverplots (yay!!) When the Random effects are the interesting part of the model - catepillar plots Be certain to include your uncertainty Part III 0.0.7 Chapter 11 Thomas Bayes - Rolls up his sleeves Philosophical and theoretical distinctions between Frequentist and Bayesian The mechanics change but the syntax remains the same Setting reasonable priors Assessing model performance Why multilevel models have a naturally Bayesian Form Pros and cons Further Reading 0.0.8 Chapter 12 (Optional) - Resources for Plotting Results of Bayesian Models 0.0.9 Chapter 13 SEM Advanced Time-Series Analyses Latent Change Score Models Non-linear change in SEM Change as a mediator in SEM Multivariate Bayesian Multilevel Regression 0.0.10 Chapter X - Meta Analyses - “Variance Known” MLMs (stretch - may remove) 0.0.11 Resources: First and Second Moments of Repeated Measures Distributions Dejonckheere et al., 2019 Houben et al., 2015 Non-linear Models Kira et al., 2019 Guastello, 2013 Time-series Analyses Ghiasi et al., 2020 Puterman et al., 2020 "]
